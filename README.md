# Verilog
This is a mini project using Verilog HDL
This traffic light controller is implemented using Verilog HDL, and it models a traffic light intersection with two roads, A and B. The traffic light controller uses a finite state machine (FSM) to control the timing and sequencing of the traffic lights.

Let's take a closer look at the code to understand how it works.

Inputs:

clk: The clock input
Sa: The input signal from road A's sensor
Sb: The input signal from road B's sensor
Outputs:

Ra: The output signal for the red light on road A
Rb: The output signal for the red light on road B
Ga: The output signal for the green light on road A
Gb: The output signal for the green light on road B
Ya: The output signal for the yellow light on road A
Yb: The output signal for the yellow light on road B
